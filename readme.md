# multipleChoiceGame

# description
The provided code is a JavaScript quiz game. It has a list of multiple-choice questions and the player has to select the correct answer within a given time frame. The game keeps track of the player's score and displays it at the end of the quiz.

The game starts with a start button, which is disabled once the game starts. The game has a timer that counts down from 100 seconds, and if the player doesn't select an answer within that time, the game ends. The timer is displayed on the screen.

The game has a list of questions with four multiple-choice answers. The game displays one question at a time, and the player has to select one of the multiple-choice answers. If the player selects the correct answer, the game displays a "correct" message, increments the score by 1, and moves on to the next question. If the player selects the wrong answer, the game displays a "wrong" message, decrements the time left by 5 seconds, and moves on to the next question.

Once all questions are answered, the game ends, and the final score is displayed on the screen along with the player's highest score, which is stored in the browser's local storage.
